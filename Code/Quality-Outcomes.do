A selection of their responses is shown in Tables 4.3 to 4.10. A full list of the activities that both main and partner respondents were asked about were reading to their child; telling stories not from a book; doing musical activities; drawing, painting, or making things; playing sports or physically active games; playing with toys or games indoors; and going to a park or outdoor playground with their children.The extent to which parents engage in such activities may be influenced by a number of factors including whether or not they work, how much time they have at home to spend with their children, how many other children they have, and what resources are available to them. The list of activities included in questions is not exhaustive and parents may spend time with their children in activities that were not asked about. There may specifically be culture- specific activities that were not included in the questionnaire.Mothers reported engaging in all activities more often than did fathers, with the exception of playing sports or physically active games. Mothers reported reading to their children more frequently than any of the other activities.Similar patterns can be seen across the various activities and for both mothers and fathers. Parents in England tended to engage in the activities less frequently than those in other countries, with parents in Scotland and Northern Ireland engaging in many activities more frequently than did parents in England and Wales. Pakistani and Bangladeshi parents tended to engage in activities less frequently than other parents and black parents also reported slightly lower frequency of involvement.Differences by parental employment status were not consistent. Parents who were not working were more likely to be clustered at each end of the response options; for most activities, a higher percentage of parents who were not working reported engaging in the activity every day and a higher percentage also reported never engaging in the activity. Other than this, there were few consistent differences. Mothers who were employed reported more frequently engaging in sports and physically active games but less frequently reading to their children. Employed fathers read to their children more frequently, but were less often engaged in story-telling and musical activities.*//*MCS4: Child obesity?*/local parentVars dmcmkd00 dmcswhaa dmcswhab dmcswhac dmscfcaa dmrstpaa daoutc00 mcsid dmsctya0 dmrabsa0 dmsabsa0 dmwabsa0 dmasmia0 dmasuna0 dmamtha0 dmareda0 dmineva0 dmhlwxa0 dmalrda0 dmalwha0use `parentVars' using "/Users/pedm/Documents/jobs/Damian-Clarke/Data/Raw/MCS-Survey-4/stata9_se/mcs4_parent_interview.dta"rename mcsid MCSID* Interesting: Variable = dmcmkd00	Variable label = S4 MAIN Whether plan to have more children  * Pos. = 800	Variable = dmcswhaa	Variable label = S4 MAIN Reason for more than one school MC1 C1  * Pos. = 801	Variable = dmcswhab	Variable label = S4 MAIN Reason for more than one school MC2 C1  * Pos. = 802	Variable = dmcswhac	Variable label = S4 MAIN Reason for more than one school MC3 C1  * Value = 3	Label = Excluded from previous school  * Value = 7	Label = Moved in order to go to a better school* Finding: many examples of "Moved in order to go to a better school."
