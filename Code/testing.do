***** CURRENT GOAL: confirm results that I sent damian. Impact of turning on/off switches? and computing birth order just as I was doing before?









* Compare to agefirstbirth previously
* Consider doing similar to find twins AND twins birth order!



* In HHGrid Wave 3, look at outcomes for height, weight, sally anne, pattern, naming, etc. But only exists for CM
